Do you want to know the last straw for an undertaker?
 * [Yes, please] -> yes
 * [No, I don't] -> no
 
 === yes ===
 Being trapped with the dead,
 that's why I put up a ladder in my cabin to run away.
    -> END
    
=== no ===
I'm just trying to exorcise the fear.
Well, the undead are slow,
if you see one of them you should go faster!
    -> END
